# Where to find more databases?
You have 2 main options: 

1. Build them yourself from a FASTA of sequences and a QIIME-compatible taxonomy (see instructions)
2. Visit http://ninja-ops.ninja/db or http://metagenome.cs.umn.edu/ninja/databases to download from some popular options (SILVA, UNITE, ...)
